        Electronic governance or e-governance is the application of information and communication technology (ICT) for delivering government services, exchange of information, communication transactions, integration of various stand-alone systems and services
        between government-to-citizen (G2C), government-to-business (G2B), government-to-government (G2G), government-to-employees (G2E) as well as back-office processes and interactions within the entire government framework.Through e-governance, government
        services are made available to citizens in a convenient, efficient, and transparent manner. The three main target groups that can be distinguished in governance concepts are government, citizens, and businesses/interest groups. In e-governance,
        there are no distinct boundaries

        Poor governance has been undermining the service delivery and development initiatives undertaken by the majority of developing countries. Many of these governments have now started using e-governance as a mechanism to engender change in their governance
        systems for achieving development goals and to ensure better service delivery to citizens and other stakeholders. Arguably, it also ensures improved public sector efficiency, accountability and responsiveness. The paper argues that a successful
        adoption of e-governments has the potential to provide better service delivery at reduced costs, increase public sector efficiency, minimise corruption and improve the accountability, transparency and responsiveness of the public sector. It is,
        however, acknowledged that such initiatives in developing countries are fraught with numerous challenges that include the lack of infrastructure, low tele-density, lack of political commitment and vision, bureaucratic inefficiency and administrative
        corruption. The framework also identifies the challenges that may face, the external environment they are influenced by, and the role they play in achieving better governance.
